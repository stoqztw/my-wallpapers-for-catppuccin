> This is my repository where I store wallpapers for catppuccin themes. All wallpapers do not belong to me and were taken from different repositories and sites, I only chose the best in my opinion!

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stoqztw/my-wallpapers-for-catppuccin.git
```

> The repository will be expanded as new wallpapers are found.
